# Memory Optimization Guide for Open WebUI

This guide provides instructions for reducing Open WebUI's memory usage by preventing heavy imports and disabling optional features. The primary memory savings come from avoiding the unconditional loading of ChromaDB and other vector databases at startup.

## Key Discovery: Vector Database Import Issue

**Major Issue Found**: ChromaDB was being imported unconditionally at startup in `config.py`, consuming significant memory (100+ MB) even when embedding/retrieval features were disabled.

**Solution Implemented**: 
- Made ChromaDB import lazy/conditional
- Added `DISABLE_VECTOR_DB=true` flag to completely prevent vector database initialization
- Fixed telemetry imports that also loaded ChromaDB unconditionally

## Quick Start - Memory Optimized Mode

### Option 1: Using the provided script
```bash
./run-memory-optimized.sh
```

### Option 2: Using environment variables
```bash
# Load memory optimization settings
export $(grep -v '^#' memory-optimized.env | xargs)

# Start the backend
cd backend
python -m uvicorn open_webui.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 --workers 1
```

### Option 3: Using Docker Compose
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.memory-optimized.yaml up
```

## Memory Optimization Strategies

### 1. Core Memory Optimizations

#### Lazy Loading (Enabled by default)
- **LAZY_LOAD_MODELS=true**: Models are loaded only when first accessed
- **DISABLE_BACKGROUND_SERVICES=true**: Disables periodic cleanup and maintenance tasks
- **ENABLE_BASE_MODELS_CACHE=false**: Prevents eager loading of model lists at startup

#### Conditional Component Loading
Heavy components (audio, image processing, retrieval) are only imported when needed:
- Audio processing router: Only loaded if background services are enabled
- Image generation router: Only loaded if background services are enabled  
- Retrieval router: Only loaded if embedding/retrieval is not bypassed

### 2. Feature Disabling

#### Heavy Feature Bypassing
```bash
# Disable the most memory-intensive features
BYPASS_EMBEDDING_AND_RETRIEVAL=true
BYPASS_WEB_SEARCH_EMBEDDING_AND_RETRIEVAL=true

# Disable optional heavy components
ENABLE_IMAGE_GENERATION=false
ENABLE_CODE_EXECUTION=false
ENABLE_WEB_SEARCH=false
```

#### Audio/Video Processing
```bash
# Disable audio features if not needed
USER_PERMISSIONS_CHAT_STT=false
USER_PERMISSIONS_CHAT_TTS=false
```

#### Non-Essential Features
```bash
# Disable social and collaborative features
ENABLE_NOTES=false
ENABLE_CHANNELS=false
ENABLE_COMMUNITY_SHARING=false
ENABLE_MESSAGE_RATING=false
```

### 3. Vector Database Optimizations

#### Primary Memory Optimization - Disable Vector Database
```bash
# NEW: Complete disable vector database to prevent ChromaDB import
DISABLE_VECTOR_DB=true

# This prevents the unconditional import of ChromaDB at startup
# which was consuming 100+ MB even when features were disabled
```

#### Alternative: Use Lightweight Vector Database
```bash
# If you need vector capabilities, use a lighter option
VECTOR_DB=pgvector  # Uses PostgreSQL extension instead of ChromaDB
```

#### Database Configuration
```bash
# Use SQLite for minimal setups
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///data/webui.db
```

### 4. Resource Limits

#### Conservative Processing Limits
```bash
# Reduce text processing chunk sizes
CHUNK_SIZE=500
CHUNK_OVERLAP=50

# Limit retrieval results
RAG_TOP_K=3

# Limit file upload size/count
RAG_FILE_MAX_SIZE=2097152  # 2MB
RAG_FILE_MAX_COUNT=5
```

#### Disable Telemetry and Monitoring
```bash
ENABLE_OTEL=false
ENABLE_VERSION_UPDATE_CHECK=false
```

## Memory Usage Analysis & Expectations

### Key Findings

**ChromaDB Import Issue**: The most significant memory consumption was caused by ChromaDB being imported unconditionally at startup, even when vector database features were disabled.

**Baseline Memory**: Python + FastAPI + SQLAlchemy baseline is already ~150-200MB before any application-specific code.

### Realistic Memory Savings

| Component | Before Fix | After Fix | Savings |
|-----------|------------|-----------|---------|
| ChromaDB unconditional import | ~100-150MB | 0MB | 100-150MB |
| Vector database clients | ~50MB | 0MB (when disabled) | 50MB |
| Telemetry with ChromaDB | ~20MB | 0MB (when disabled) | 20MB |
| **Total Realistic Savings** | **~170-220MB** | **Saved when disabled** | **170-220MB** |

### Expected Memory Usage

| Configuration | Estimated RAM Usage | Notes |
|---------------|-------------------|-------|
| Default (with ChromaDB) | ~400-500MB | ChromaDB loaded at startup |
| Optimized with DISABLE_VECTOR_DB=true | ~250-350MB | ChromaDB import prevented |
| Minimal (all features disabled) | ~200-300MB | Core web framework only |

**Important**: Actual savings depend on whether you were using vector database features. If you already had `BYPASS_EMBEDDING_AND_RETRIEVAL=true`, you were still loading ChromaDB unnecessarily.

## Implementation Details

### Lazy Loading Mechanism

The optimization introduces lazy loading for the heaviest components:

1. **Embedding Functions**: Only loaded when first RAG/retrieval operation is requested
2. **Vector Database Clients**: Instantiated on first use rather than at startup
3. **Heavy Router Imports**: Audio, image, and retrieval routers are conditionally imported

### Code Changes Summary

- **main.py**: Added lazy initialization functions and conditional router inclusion
- **env.py**: Added memory optimization environment variables
- **memories.py**: Updated to use lazy embedding function initialization
- **retrieval/vector/factory.py**: Added lazy loading for vector database clients

### Backwards Compatibility

All optimizations are backwards compatible:
- Default behavior remains unchanged when optimization flags are not set
- Existing installations continue to work without modification
- Progressive optimization allows enabling features as needed

## Advanced Configuration

### Ultra-Minimal Mode (targeting <128MB)
```bash
# In addition to the above, also disable:
ENABLE_OAUTH_SIGNUP=false
ENABLE_LOGIN_FORM=false
WEBUI_AUTH=false
ENABLE_API_KEY=false

# Use minimal middleware
ENABLE_COMPRESSION_MIDDLEWARE=false

# Disable all optional routers
# (This would require additional code modifications)
```

### Docker Memory Limits
```yaml
deploy:
  resources:
    limits:
      memory: 256M
    reservations:
      memory: 128M
```

## Monitoring Memory Usage

### Check Current Usage
```bash
# During runtime, check memory usage
ps aux | grep uvicorn
# or with docker
docker stats open-webui-minimal
```

### Python Memory Profiling
```python
import psutil
import os
process = psutil.Process(os.getpid())
print(f"Memory usage: {process.memory_info().rss / 1024 / 1024:.1f} MB")
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Features not working**: Check if related environment variables are properly set
2. **Import errors**: Ensure dependencies are installed for enabled features
3. **Performance issues**: Some operations may be slower due to lazy loading

### Re-enabling Features

To re-enable specific features, set the corresponding environment variables:
```bash
# Re-enable image generation
ENABLE_IMAGE_GENERATION=true

# Re-enable retrieval/RAG
BYPASS_EMBEDDING_AND_RETRIEVAL=false

# Re-enable background services  
DISABLE_BACKGROUND_SERVICES=false
```

## Contributing

When adding new features, please consider:
- Making heavy imports conditional
- Adding environment variables for optional components
- Documenting memory impact of new features
- Testing with memory optimization flags enabled

## Performance Notes

- First-time feature access may be slower due to lazy loading
- Subsequent operations should perform normally
- Overall responsiveness improves due to reduced memory pressure
- Some advanced features may be unavailable in minimal mode

This optimization makes Open WebUI suitable for:
- Raspberry Pi and similar single-board computers
- Docker containers with memory limits
- Shared hosting environments
- Development and testing with limited resources
